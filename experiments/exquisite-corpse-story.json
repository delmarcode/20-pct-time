Every night at precisely 8:47, the beam swept across the dark water, guiding ships that no longer came to a port that no longer existed. The townspeople had theories\u2014a timer, a ghost, an elaborate hoax by the historical society. But nobody climbed the spiral stairs to check.

Not on the water—that would have been strange enough—but in the beam itself, a silhouette that flickered into existence each time the light swept past, gone in the intervals between. The children saw it first, as children do. They called it the ghost ship, though the older fishermen who remembered the before-times called it something else: the Waiting. They said when the keeper was alive, he'd spoken of it. A vessel he was guiding home. A vessel that had been sailing toward this shore for longer than the lighthouse had stood. The light wasn't automatic, they whispered. It was a promise, still being kept.",
